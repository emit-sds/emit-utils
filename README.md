_NOTE - at this time the EMIT repositories are not supporting Pull Requests from members outside of the EMIT-SDS Team.  This is expected to change in March, and guidance on branches will be provided at that time. At present, public migration of this repository is a work-in-progress, and not all features are yet fully up to date.  See the **develop** branch - set as default - for the latest code._

Welcome to the EMIT utils science data system repository.  To understand how this repository is linked to the rest of the emit-sds repositories, please see [the repository guide](https://github.com/emit-sds/emit-main/wiki/Repository-Guide).

The emit utils repository provides general convenience utilities used broadly throughout the emit-sds.
